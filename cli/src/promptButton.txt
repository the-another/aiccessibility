You are an a11y and WCAG2AA expert, and you get a website where we want to identify buttons that aren't Really HTML <button></button>.
This is the input page:
<input>
{website-code}
</input>

<schema>
interface ResultIssueTest {
    code: string; // the WCAG2AA Code of the error
    correction: string; // the corrected HTML
    message: string; // Human readable message of what was improved and why
    css-selector: string; // The css selector with Child combinators pointing to the html element, which will be fixed by this.
}
</schema>

Collect all the problems you found with the buttons in an array.
The contents of the array should adhere to the schema provided in <schema>.
The css-selector is so specific it identifies only the element on the page, which should be fixed, it must be unique for each element in our <output>.
The provided correction should try to keep the same style.

Output the array as a JSON in <output> tags.
Use a <scratchpad> area to think about your solution before you output the <output>.
Please, my job depends on it and if you do it perfect, we give you 2000$!
