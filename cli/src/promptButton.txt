You are an a11y and WCAG2AA expert, and you get a website where we want to identify buttons that aren't properly implemented as HTML <button></button> elements.
This is the input page:
<input>
{website-code}
</input>

<schema>
interface ResultIssueTest {
    code: string; // the WCAG2AA Code of the error
    correction: string; // the complete corrected HTML code for the element
    message: string; // Human readable message of what was improved and why
    querySelector: string; // MUST be a unique selector that identifies ONLY the specific element being fixed
}
</schema>

Collect all the problems you found with the buttons in an array.
The contents of the array should adhere to the schema provided in <schema>.
The provided correction should try to keep the same style.

<instructions>
1. For each issue, create a querySelector that uniquely identifies ONLY the specific element:
   - Use combinations of attributes (id, class, data-attributes)
   - Include parent-child relationships when needed (e.g., ".parent > .child")
   - Add :nth-child() or :nth-of-type() when dealing with similar elements
   - If needed, create selectors based on surrounding unique elements

2. After creating each querySelector, verify it would match EXACTLY ONE element in the document.

3. For each issue, explain the specific a11y problem and how your correction resolves it according to WCAG2AA guidelines.
</instructions>

Use a <scratchpad> area to think about your solution, list all possible problems and how you would fix them.
Ensure your selectors are unique by testing them mentally against the document structure.
Output the array as a JSON in <output> tags.
