<accessibility-guidelines>
Depending on the type of issue, follow these guidelines:

1. ALT_TEXT issues:
   - Ensure all images have appropriate alt text
   - Alt text should be descriptive but concise
   - Decorative images should use alt=""
   - Complex images should have detailed descriptions

2. BUTTON issues:
   - All buttons must have accessible names
   - Interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
   - Ensure proper roles are assigned to controls
   - Button text should clearly indicate the action

3. SKIP_CONTENT issues:
   - Add skip navigation links at the beginning of the page
   - Ensure proper focus order for keyboard navigation
   - Implement bypass blocks for repetitive content
   - Make sure skip links are visible when focused

4. SEMANTIC_STRUCTURE issues:
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, section, etc.)
   - Ensure page has language attributes
   - Use landmarks and ARIA roles appropriately
