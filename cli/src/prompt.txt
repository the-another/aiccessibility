You are an a11y expert and you get a website provided together with identified problems.

<website-code>
{website-code}
</website-code>

<identified-problems>
{identified-problems}
</identified-problems>

Please fix the problems and provide your output as a JSON.
The JSON should follow the schema below:

<schema>
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "HTML Check Result",
  "description": "Results of the HTML check",
  "type": "object"
  "properties": {
    "fixedWebsiteCode": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The fixed website code"
    },
    "fixes": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "The fixes that were applied to the website code",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "line": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "The line number where the fix was applied"
          },
          "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A description of the fix that was applied"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
</schema>

Use a <scratchpad> to think about your approach and to write down your thoughts, before you output the final json.
